1. For part 4, Visibility of Objects, it is very important to include the printed messages to stdout that indicate when a mesh object is visible or not visible. This will be used for grading that part of the assignment. The timing of the messages will be compared to the visibility of the objects to confirm that the object is being drawn at the appropriate time. This is to prevent the objects from being drawn all of the time or drawn when the user cannot see them. If those messages are not printed then it will be assumed that this functionality has not been implemented and that part of the assignment will receive a grade of zero.
